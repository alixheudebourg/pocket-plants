# Pocket Plants Backend ðŸŒ±

A Node.js backend service for managing a comprehensive plant database and garden management system. This API provides endpoints for tracking plants, managing gardens, accessing plant information based on biomes and growing seasons, and supporting React frontend integration.

## Features

- **Enhanced Plant Database**: Comprehensive plant information including planting/harvest times, care notes, difficulty levels, and biome compatibility
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter plants by category, difficulty, biome, season, and care level
- **Search Functionality**: Search plants by name, description, or category
- **Seasonal Recommendations**: Get plant suggestions based on month and climate zone
- **Biome Support**: Plant recommendations based on USDA climate zones (6B, 7A, 7B, 8A)
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination for large plant lists
- **Garden Management Ready**: API structure ready for user garden features

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing support
- **ES Modules** - Modern JavaScript module system
- **File-based Database** - JSON-based plant data storage

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pocket-plants-backend
```

npm start
```

### Testing Endpoints
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the interactive API documentation with clickable links to test all endpoints.

### Adding New Plants
Edit `data/plants.json` to add new plants following the established schema structure.

### Adding New Endpoints
Implement new routes in `server.js` following the existing pattern with proper error handling.

## Frontend Integration

This backend is designed to work seamlessly with React frontends:

- **Plant List Pages**: Use `/plants` with filtering for category/plant type pages
- **Product Detail Pages (PDPs)**: Use `/plants/:id` for individual plant pages
- **Search**: Use `/plants/search` for plant search functionality
- **Seasonal Recommendations**: Use `/plants/seasonal` for time-based suggestions
- **Filtering**: Use query parameters for advanced plant filtering

## Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling:
- **400** - Bad Request (missing required parameters)
- **404** - Not Found (plant not found, invalid endpoint)
- **500** - Internal Server Error (server issues)

## Performance Features

- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination for large datasets
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized filtering algorithms
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of data loading failures
- **CORS Ready**: Configured for frontend integration
